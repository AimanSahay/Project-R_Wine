# Creating a one variable Linear Regression Model
model1 <- lm(Price~AGST, data=wine)
summary(model1)

model1$residuals

SSE <- sum(model1$residuals^2)

# Adding more independent variables to linear regression
model2 <- lm(Price ~ AGST+HarvestRain, data=wine)

SSE <- sum(model2$residuals^2)

# Building a model using all independent variables
model3 <- lm(Price ~ AGST+HarvestRain+WinterRain+Age+FrancePop, data = wine)

# Improving the model by removing insignificant variables based on p values
model4 <- lm(Price ~ AGST+HarvestRain+WinterRain+Age, data=wine)
summary(model4)
# Observation: This model is as good as model 3 without including FrancePop variable and the adjusted R squared is also higher.

# Calculating Correlation
cor(wine$WinterRain, wine$Price)

cor(wine$Age, wine$FrancePop) # Almost -1 correlation coefficient: indicates multicollinearity

cor(wine)
# Observation: Using the correlation matrix, it seems that except multicollinearity between Age and France Population, there is no problem of multicollinearity between other independent variables.

# Checking the goodness of the model by removing Age and FrancePop from model3 as that model had indicated both these variables to be insignificant.
model5 <- lm(Price ~ AGST+HarvestRain+WinterRain, data=wine)
summary(model5)

# Observation: model 4 is better than model 5 as the R squared in model 4 > model 5
# Conclusion: Out of all models created, model 4 has the highest R squared and looks like the right model for this data.

# Checking for model accuracy using out of sample data
wineTest <- read.csv("wine_test.csv")
str(wineTest)

predictTest <- predict(model4, newdata=wineTest)
predictTest

SSE <- sum((wineTest$Price - predictTest)^2)
SST <- sum((wineTest$Price - mean(wine$Price))^2)
rsquared <- 1 - SSE/SST
rsquared

# Observation: R squared of 0.79 is quite good for the test set data. But since there are only 2 data points in the test data set, we cannot reach any strong conclusions.
